# WoW Info

Currently accessible here with mock data: [WoW-Info](https://wow-info.vercel.app/)

The goal of this project is to have all kinds of leaderboard information in 1 place using 3 World of Warcraft API's (Battle.net, Raider.IO and WarcraftLogs).

The idea is to be a mix of [Warcraft Logs](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/), [Raider.io](https://raider.io/) and [mplus-title.vercel.app](https://mplus-title.vercel.app/df-season-3?regions=us)
